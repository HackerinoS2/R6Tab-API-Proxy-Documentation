## About R6Tab API Proxy

R6Tab API Proxy, as the name says, is a proxy to the R6TAB API.

The goal with this API is to make R6TAB API publicly available again.

To be able to use this proxy, you need an API Key. To get one, you need to contact me and justify the usage of the API
(Example: Hey, I need an API Key for R6Tab API Proxy because I'm making a great discord bot that displays my friend's ranks with custom commands)

## But R6API made their API private because of abuse, then your API is a bypass to that?

No, but actually yes. I'm pretty aware that Tabwire made their R6 API private due to people abusing it. But, they had **No Limits** to the amount of requests that could be made.

This API Proxy on the other hand, it's limited/throttled to 10 requests per minute (per API Key), and we also cache the requests results for 15 minutes, so we don't "hit" the original API to much.

## Who do I need to contact to get an API Key and how?

You need to contact me, the creator of this project. You can contact me via:

**Discord:** Hackerino#0001 (preferred)

**Email:** ruifsilvaoliveira@gmail.com (Make sure the email's subject is "API Key request" or something like that)

## How to use (In Progress)
